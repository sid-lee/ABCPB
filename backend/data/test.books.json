  "description": "A cornered woman is a dangerous animal. Some in Julie Morton’s second novel, Deadly Keyholes, pay for this lesson with their lives. Miranda LaVelle, an abused, neglected child of the Roaring 20s Jazz Age, is rescued from poverty and probable death by her great aunt, Genevieve Woods. Genevieve’s gritty life in a wild, oil boomtown in South Arkansas is not suitable for a child, but there is no choice. To four-year-old Miranda, her new circumstances are more wonderful than she could have ever imagined. Doting women, plenty of food, clean clothes, and bedding, what else could one want? But, even after miraculously becoming a world-renowned, concert pianist, her life and the lives of those around her are not easy. Multiple, grisly murders haunt them. If you appreciate powerful, independent women who will do whatever is necessary to protect those they love, then come, share Miranda’s journey. Let her story reassure you of the resilience of the human spirit and restore your hope that all darkness passes, and then comes the dawn.",

For thirty-one years, Lila has hidden her extrasensory abilities, creating a small life in the same coastal North Carolina city where she was born. But her nightmares have grown worse, her angels still haven't learned Morse code, and raising a thirteen-year-old genius requires the kind of mental focus that Lila has never quite mastered. Still, the abnormal seems fairly normal-until a strange young man appears and a new friend confides a shocking truth about her pregnancy. Sal, on the other hand, has never attempted to hide. In his experience, humans do not see what they do not wish to acknowledge. He moves among them, identifying the aberrations as he always has, as he knows he must. This existence depends upon it. But one choice made long ago, one decision born of guilt and fear, is now a secret he must protect-at any cost.\nPhasellus sit amet erat. Nulla tempus. Vivamus in felis eu sapien cursus vestibulum.",

Unashamedly a feel-good novel, The Wood and the Trees is a witty portraiture of 1980s London with its rich humour and a large caste of unforgettable characters.  We follow rugby player, Archie Henderson, in the last week of school who is desperate to leave a torrid home life for university. A last-minute expulsion for defending a cross-dressing Vinnie Pritchard is finally overcome and Archie is spat out into the big wide world. A Summer’s work experience in New Orleans and travels across the USA to Hollywood expose a new world to Archie.  Finishing university Archie enters the stock market – a world that thrums with the volatile energy of the dealing room and a relationships-based business full of the gossip and rumour. His entry into The City opens a variety of doors for him where the people he meets are central to the dramatic denouement of the book.",

  "description": "“A masterpiece!... I recommend this memoir to anyone looking for inspiration to make a difference in the world.” - Liliane Pari Umuhoza, Founder of the Women Genocide Survivors Retreat\n\nA proud American blends memoir with a joyful cultural peek into his often misunderstood religious community. *ONLY this E-book version has the COLOR photos of a community often depicted in Black & White! Enjoy!\n\nA young boy is cleaning a guinea pig hutch. Over the next two decades, he will go on to become a rabbi, psychiatric medical clinician, and officer in the United States Air Force. But right now, he’s about to turn around and face a small contingent of stern Hasidic elders. While certain he’d broken some sacred rule, what happened next is just one of many lessons that taught the rabbi that heroism comes in all shapes and sizes, and wisdom often confronts us when we least expect it.\n\nFor anyone curious about exploring Jewish culture, this heartwarming coming-of-age story is for you. Levi Welton, a shy Hasidic boy offers a compelling insider's view and a sense of humanity to what it was like growing up in the radical shtetl of Bezerkely, California while trying to unite the often-fraught nature of secular society with his Hasidic upbringing. This book offers a nuanced view into the day-to-day lives of religious Jews, yet it is also about the stories, moments and people who shape us all. With signature humor, kindness and wisdom, Rabbi Welton asks: what is important? What is valuable? What is heroism?\n\nOn his journey from self-doubt to self-acceptance, Levi collects invaluable lessons about faith, family, social activism, being proud of who you are, and seeing the good in everyone through an assortment of funny yet inspiring stories—from adopting stray animals while in the Boy Scouts, to learning life secrets from a hippie in the Wyoming wilds. Welton’s brilliant memoir-in-essays makes an invaluable contribution to the national conversation about race—in particular, the often neglected experiences of Hasidic Americans. Some readers will find a welcome spark of recognition; others will encounter a fresh perspective.\n\nAlong the way, you'll meet his childhood community of eccentric, colorful, and endearing role models and mentors. The essays in this collection portray the \"superheroes\" of Rabbi Welton's life-- his father, grandmother, the Rebbe and his mother-- leaving you to ponder your own hidden yet essential superheroes you've encountered along the way. It is for anyone who needs reminding that a heroic life can only be born from radical honesty and the courage to shed facades and be . . . you.\n\nBe Like the Moon strengthens your faith in humanity by sharing wisdom that will speak to anyone, of any (or no) faith, who’s ever struggled with life’s weighty challenges. No subject is off-limits – addiction, depression, racism, and even a walk on the (atheistic) wild side! Yet running through all these is a powerful lesson—one about heroism:\n\nYou don't need superpowers to be a hero. You can change the world through the quiet impact you have on others by simply living your life.\n\nIt’s a transformative book, with insights on every page and an inspiring message of optimism, hope, and yes, heroism—minus the superpowers! It is the author’s hope is that these stories will inspire you to light up your own life with humble heroism and rediscover the spiritual superhero you were before the world put a label on you.\n\n“Authenticity and love of one’s fellow man emanate from Levi Welton’s life and words. He calls for and exemplifies an integration of ‘distinct cultures fused together.’ This is a rabbi's call to personal greatness and one man’s honest and sincere reflection on the path of fully being both a Jew and a committed member of the human family.” - Rabbi Zalman Kastel, Founder of the non-profit Together For Humanity",

But this is not Samantha’s idea. She has never been in or on the ocean before. Will the bubble bounce around on the waves and make her seasick all the time? Will stormy seas make her fall overboard and drown?

Carousing with prostitutes, gambling away his fortunes, and carrying on clandestine affairs with the married elite of Belle Époque Paris, he wiles away his days, and nights, drinking deeply from the cup of carnal delights both divine and devilish. But even pleasure has its limits.\n\n\nSo, when the infernal emissary Arman Sur appears with an offer of a life of sensual passions unimaginable in exchange for his soul, a deal is struck that will lead Etienne on a journey to the heights of rapture and the edge of madness.\n\n\nDecades later, an ageless and aimless Etienne wanders the earth like Cain bemoaning his self-inflicted tortures. That is until fate intercedes, and the reappearance of a one-time enemy bearing a remarkable secret sets Etienne on a new journey to reap his own vengeance upon the devil and reclaim his lost soul.",

  "description": "Part mystery, part love story, part survival epic … from the rolling hills of Virginia to the remote wilds of Alaska, All Good Quests casts a sharp eye on the rugged terrain of the human heart.\n\nJournalist Brogan Quint is, according to his editor, “the quintessential vagabond,” a rolling stone, a satellite in eternal orbit. He’s also broken, haunted by a tragedy that took place nearly half his life ago.\n\nWhen famous tech mogul John Breckon seemingly vanishes from the face of the earth, Quint, like the rest of the world, is sucked in by the mystery. As he begins to dig into the riddle of Breckon's disappearance, Quint discovers an idyllic town, a woman with a tragic past of her own, and a second chance at happiness. But Quint soon realizes he has a few things in common with John Breckon, and his interest in the missing man quickly spirals into an obsession—an obsession that may cost him his life …",

  "description": "Believing a more fulfilling future awaits him elsewhere, Shawn leaves his career in Washington, DC, and embarks on a year-long adventure. On the final leg of his journey, he travels to Europe and spends months walking a thousand miles across France and Spain, following the ancient pilgrimage road known as the Camino.\n\n\nPart memoir and part travelogue, in this book Shawn vividly describes some of Europe's most spectacular landscapes, and shares the challenges he encounters with language barriers, foreign customs, and the physical hardships of life as a pilgrim. Travelling in the centuries-old footsteps of the pilgrims who've gone before him, he seeks to uncover the true meaning of a pilgrimage.\n\n\nAs he adjusts to the day-to-day rigors of such a long journey, Shawn sees the Camino's rich connection to history. He delves into the lives and legacies of the figures associated with some of the milestones along his walk, revisiting the folklore surrounding the lives of Sainte Foy and the rise of Christianity, Roland and the advent of chivalry, and El Cid and the fate of the Reconquista.\n\n\nSharing tales of thieving monks, savage priests, and banished knights, Shawn brings Europe's colorful past to life. While sifting through fact and legend, he provides a sweeping narrative of the medieval ages as it relates to Europe, Christianity, and this pilgrimage.\n\n\nAs his own journey unfolds, Shawn finds humor and wisdom in each misstep. He shares the insights that come to him as he faces the obstacles between him and his goal. Walking over mountains, across plains, and through storms, Shawn embraces the commitment required to fulfill his dream. Through this journey of self-discovery, Shawn learns what it truly means to be a pilgrim, and finds what we all seek-a life of meaning and purpose.\n\n\nPick up your copy of A Thousand Miles to Santiago and start the adventure today!",

When his father urges him to join the military to help reclaim their colony, Galian is forced to put aside his oath to Do No Harm and fight a war he does not believe in. Across the great Madion Sea, Captain Theo Kallistrate dreams of a day when she is no longer bound by conscription to fight for her country's independence. But when the Kylaens threaten, honor and duty call her to the front lines to fight off the oppressors. When an air skirmish goes wrong, both Theo and Galian crash on a remote island hundreds of miles from either nation. Grievously injured, Theo must rely on Galian's medical expertise, and Galian must rely on Theo's survival skills, to live another day in a harsh and unforgiving terrain. Can they put aside their differences long enough to survive? Or will the war that brought them to the island tear them apart? The Island is the first in a new romance trilogy by S.

Each story will linger in your mind well after you have read them. – Lauren Smith, Author\n\nAn intriguing compendium of compelling, thought-provoking, and somewhat surreal short stories – modern in both writing style and outlook. – Deborah Murrell, Author and Editor\n\nDive into the stories of souls at play. Meet the borderless characters who enter each other's destinies, grow together and flow apart. Jump with them from one drip to another; suck up the bits of color from every page and leave some on the drips behind.\n\nPete’s letters are never read by Cate but by a stranger. Zoe’s voice diminishes to a whisper and then to a silence to find what she is looking for. Cora is carried away by the conversation between two strangers she overheard on a bus before facing her reality. Agnes never finds out how a tattoo of a tree appeared on her shoulder. She accepts and embraces the tree as it responds to her emotions; Agnes is not alone anymore. John’s longing for his past hits a glitch. Dennis plays a mind game with his wife in a civilized way. Egan never finds the door to take him where he wants to go. Mateo questions if he knows Bella more after exchanging 46,127 words over text messages than reading her profile of 250 words. The author in the book creates a world for Pete, Agnes, Cate and others with the spur of inspiration from a painting on a stone. After he completes the last chapter, he searches for the picture of the painting he took. He realizes that it is not the same as he remembered. Maya plays her game until she gets hungry and Anthony confuses which of several caves to put the tree house back into when the rest of the world tries to figure out what is going on. Ash lets his soul go free from his body. Spiro goes to the cemetery to stay alive.",

With promises of glory and absinthe martinis, she convinces close friends Evan Neruda, a struggling journalist with Latin charm, and Lyla Finch, a corporate worker bee with an irreverent streak, to help her investigate the thefts.\n\nHumorous interactions abound as their paths collide with a zany ensemble of characters. But as the friends dig deeper into the crimes, the facts become murky, the list of suspects grows, and in a startling crescendo, Annabel finds herself face-to-face with the perils of pursuing the truth.",

  "description": "The first book in the Woken series, Awoken is a story about the Highly Sensitive life.\n\nAwoken immerses readers in the lives of seven Highly Sensitive characters, who range all over the spectrum in terms of age, race, gender, ability, sexuality, and even species. With each chapter of Awoken , readers spend a day in the life of one of our seven POV characters, Denny, Charlie, Corrine, Desiree, Destiny, Cassie, or Josiah, who all reside near the same fictional North Carolina college, in the fall of 2027.\n\nAs they each try to survive their own unique set of challenges, our characters invite readers into the deepest layers of their thoughts, feelings, memories, and dreams. While they strive to heal from traumas, confront fears, and forge new relationships, these seven Highly Sensitive beings reveal powerful truths that both transcend and intertwine their lives, awakening them (and readers) to the surprising connections that exist within their reality and beyond.\n\nSuspendisse potenti.

Together they quietly hide from the world in a small cottage. \n\nToo soon, reality shatters their serenity, and they must face the parochial community. Unbeknownst to all, a legend is in the making―one that will speak of courage and resilience amidst the forces that brought the couple together even as outside forces threaten to tear them apart. ",

Despite your strategy, they know your company at the operational level.\n\nAnd your company is just the worst.\n\nDoing the basics right for digital initiatives becomes more difficult as complexity increases, especially where web technology is involved. Fixes and improvements are par for the course. Yet many companies are still surprised by this reality. The value of plentiful monitoring, continuous improvements, automation and operational effectiveness cannot be overstated, especially in the new world of digital. Your customers care and so should you.\n\nThey are watching.\nThey expect excellence.\nAnd you may be damaging their joy.\n\n“If you operate in the technology, marketing or customer experience community, you’ll find an enjoyable, knowledge-packed book filled with truths for web technology operations and improvement. The author’s perspective will help elevate your customer experiences and provide a solid baseline for your future efforts in web and digital technologies.”\n-Craig Hyde, CEO, Rigor.com\n\n“What if Dirty Harry Callahan was your company’s webmaster? Damaged Joy is a quick read chock full of wisdom and insights on how to avoid doing stupid things with your web presence. Go ahead - act like you want your customers to respect you. Read and heed.”\n- Walt Carter, Chief Digital Officer & CIO“The author shows you how the tools and technologies your business uses today can be a double-edged sword, if you aren’t careful. The digital technologies your business depend upon have an Achilles heel. The author shines a light into these dark places, so you don’t have to. Like Internet sensation Grumpy Cat, he takes a curmudgeon's tour through the web technologies of today, sparing nobody's ego in the process.”\n- Jeff Costa, Sr. Product Manager, Web Experience, Akamai\"The author is the real deal. Throughout these pages, he has written practical advice gained from the tough lessons of being in the trenches for the duration of the modern Internet. Web presences are more important and more complicated than ever with security, usability, and financial performance concerns. The stakes are higher than ever. His advice is not a bunch of web fluff, but it’s solid advice applicable to business leaders and young professional developers alike.”\n- Frank S.

  "description": "Beyond Pain is an in-depth look at how people cano not only live with pain but come to see it and all suffering with the eyes of faith. This is also a book about two remarkable, pain-filled lives from Scripture, Job and Jesus. The author believes that Job has much to teach those in pain. He is like each of us, she says, human and trying to do the right thing out of our flawed-but-faithful hearts. And Jesus, of course is the prime example of accepting and embracing pain even as he died on the cross. Though many of us still need strength, courage, and self-awareness to build our faith and ministry, the author says, we have Jesus' light to guide us, and his example to emulate. This book challenges readers to follow the example of Job and most of all Jesus, in accepting pain and in believing there are many joys awaiting them, if they choose to reach out, look, hope and live...beyond pain. Her book is for anyone who lives with deep, life-altering pain and who wants to have more joy, faith, and purpose. As Job did. As Jesus did.",

  "description": "Whether you are the caregiver or the patient, the “what-if’s” of the waiting room can feel terrifying, and the wait can feel agonizing. Cancer, tumor, stroke, traumatic injury, or major surgery—a health crisis of any kind involves waiting. This waiting arouses many emotions: fear, uncertainty, sorrow, agony, and anger among them. In this devotional for caregivers and patients, Elizabeth Reynolds Turnage reminds us of the certain hope and surpassing peace of the gospel: God has worked miraculous deeds and redemptive wonders in the past, and Jesus will “soon” come again to end our wait, and to bring full and final healing. These sixty meditations for peace and hope will encourage you as you wait.\nEndorsements:\n\nThis brilliant book is a tender gift of the presence of God for those caught in the deep woods of medical uncertainty. When we are in the hospital waiting for resolution, we don’t need a long chapter of admonitions or vague mumblings of comfort. We need a guide who has traversed this terrain and has a compass and a map to help us orient our journey. Elizabeth Turnage offers a wisdom that has been hard won, meets the test of the gospel, and is beautifully and brilliantly written. I can’t recommend this book more highly than to say you need a copy for yourself and eventually for every friend or family member who is called to wait for redemption.\n\nDan B. Allender PhD, Professor of Counseling Psychology, Founding PresidentThe Seattle School of Theology and Psychology\n\nElizabeth writes to anyone who finds themselves in the waiting room of God’s sovereign purposes. She meets us there as an empathetic friend reminding us what is true in His Word, urging us to listen to the refreshing lyrics of the gospel, as she beautifully models what it means to lift our eyes to the Father who is faithful to meet us in the midst of our suffering.\n\nKaren Hodge, Coordinator of Women’s Ministries Presbyterian Church in America (PCA)\n\nEach meditation includes:\nA relevant Bible verse.\nA brief story related to waiting in a health care crisis.\nA gospel reality that brings peace and hope.\nA brief concluding prayer.\nOne or two suggestions for further action—Bible reading, links to music, reflection questions, other calming activities.",

  "description": "When Bloch, a popular London novelist, starts writing a fictionalized story featuring his unremarkable friend Oscar, the invented details from the story start to come true. Gradually, Oscar embarks on a surreal odyssey into fame, while Bloch descends into the dark places of his soul. Oscar falls in love with Najette, a bewitching painter, but their relationship hangs in the balance as his myth balloons out of all proportion. At the centre of the hype and spin stands the demon-like publicist Ryan Rees, whose power enables him to manufacture the truth, and the story builds to an unforgettable, startling climax. The Fabrications is a novel possessing peculiar relevance to our tumultuous times. It addresses the myths of celebrity, the power of the internet and the media to disfigure and distort, and the madness of our culture, in which prophets, truths and legends can all be invented. Part satirical comedy; part meditation on synchronicity, sex and identity; and part love story, The Fabrications is unclassifiably new, abandoning realism to create a strange parallel world. It is a wildly inventive work, with a vast canvas of dazzling, grotesque characters, and will take you on a compelling journey filled with pathos, humour and subversive beauty.",

  "description": "The first day of junior high school is exciting, and a little scary. In The One We Left Behind, the day is ruined because of the weird, new kid in town. Due to food allergies, William and his family are forcing ridiculous food restrictions on the ENTIRE seventh grade. No more pizza. No more peanut butter. Not even a candy bar. It's completely unfair!\n\nEvan, who already has enough to worry about-maintaining his \"cool guy\" status, his reputation as the best batter in his grade, and impressing the more intimidating students and teachers-is chosen first to sit alone in a room with this geek. What kind of kid can't sit in a school cafeteria? And why should it be Evan's problem?\n\nWilliam becomes the most taunted and teased boy at school. Yet in that first week, Evan realizes he doesn't actually hate being stuck with William. No kid has EVER made Evan laugh so hard. William is also a whiz with baseball statistics, a fabulous prank puller, and a pretty good listener.\n\nBut when the week is over, will Evan risk everything to befriend the school loser? It's not his fault that William is so dorky, pale and \"different.\" Why should Evan help the \"allergy kid\" just because he was assigned to be his first \"lunch buddy?\" What is Evan supposed to do when the other kids pick on William, and the bullying starts to escalate?\n\nThe One We Left Behind explores unlikely friendships, the angst of growing up, and the desire to be accepted for who you are. It reminds readers that decisions sometimes have consequences that can never be taken back.\n\nEditorial Reviews\n\"In this debut YA novel, a teenager in 1995 finds himself torn between his social status and his growing friendship with the class nerd.\n\nJunior high is a new experience for 13-year-old Evan Roth in Columbus, Ohio. He’d been a popular athlete, but seventh grade overflows with tweens and teens from different elementary schools. Sadly, it looks as if he won’t make a good impression the first week, as he’s the assigned “lunch buddy” of the Cincinnati transfer student. William Nash has severe food allergies and must eat lunch in a classroom rather than the crowded cafeteria. Evan finds the situation alarming: “Lunch was one of the times when kids figured out who would be leaders, who would be followers, and who would be left with no friends at all.” But it turns out Evan and William have a lot in common, including their love of baseball. Being friends with William is an adjustment for Evan, as he and his fellow students learn how to use an “epi” in case the boy goes into anaphylactic shock. But William is worth it, and Evan enjoys hanging out with him. Yet Evan likes to be popular, too, which sometimes involves keeping his head down while others tease and openly mock William. Evan may have to choose—siding with insensitive bullies or a warm, funny, and generous guy. Each of Coven’s believable characters is chock-full of personality, as not all bullies are entirely apathetic and not every mother is as affectionate as Evan’s. William shows the most layers; he’s often unruffled when peers toss out insults (dubbing him Casper on account of his pale skin), but he’s devastated when convinced he’s a burden to his parents.
