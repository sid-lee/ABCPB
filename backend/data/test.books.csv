I recommend this memoir to anyone looking for inspiration to make a difference in the world.” - Liliane Pari Umuhoza, Founder of the Women Genocide Survivors Retreat\n\nA proud American blends memoir with a joyful cultural peek into his often misunderstood religious community. *ONLY this E-book version has the COLOR photos of a community often depicted in Black & White! Enjoy!\n\nA young boy is cleaning a guinea pig hutch. Over the next two decades, he will go on to become a rabbi, psychiatric medical clinician, and officer in the United States Air Force. But right now, he’s about to turn around and face a small contingent of stern Hasidic elders. While certain he’d broken some sacred rule, what happened next is just one of many lessons that taught the rabbi that heroism comes in all shapes and sizes, and wisdom often confronts us when we least expect it.\n\nFor anyone curious about exploring Jewish culture, this heartwarming coming-of-age story is for you. Levi Welton, a shy Hasidic boy offers a compelling insider's view and a sense of humanity to what it was like growing up in the radical shtetl of Bezerkely, California while trying to unite the often-fraught nature of secular society with his Hasidic upbringing. This book offers a nuanced view into the day-to-day lives of religious Jews, yet it is also about the stories, moments and people who shape us all. With signature humor, kindness and wisdom, Rabbi Welton asks: what is important? What is valuable? What is heroism?\n\nOn his journey from self-doubt to self-acceptance, Levi collects invaluable lessons about faith, family, social activism, being proud of who you are, and seeing the good in everyone through an assortment of funny yet inspiring stories—from adopting stray animals while in the Boy Scouts, to learning life secrets from a hippie in the Wyoming wilds. Welton’s brilliant memoir-in-essays makes an invaluable contribution to the national conversation about race—in particular, the often neglected experiences of Hasidic Americans. Some readers will find a welcome spark of recognition; others will encounter a fresh perspective.\n\nAlong the way, you'll meet his childhood community of eccentric, colorful, and endearing role models and mentors. The essays in this collection portray the ""superheroes"" of Rabbi Welton's life-- his father, grandmother, the Rebbe and his mother-- leaving you to ponder your own hidden yet essential superheroes you've encountered along the way. It is for anyone who needs reminding that a heroic life can only be born from radical honesty and the courage to shed facades and be . . . you.\n\nBe Like the Moon strengthens your faith in humanity by sharing wisdom that will speak to anyone, of any (or no) faith, who’s ever struggled with life’s weighty challenges. No subject is off-limits – addiction, depression, racism, and even a walk on the (atheistic) wild side! Yet running through all these is a powerful lesson—one about heroism:\n\nYou don't need superpowers to be a hero. You can change the world through the quiet impact you have on others by simply living your life.\n\nIt’s a transformative book, with insights on every page and an inspiring message of optimism, hope, and yes, heroism—minus the superpowers! It is the author’s hope is that these stories will inspire you to light up your own life with humble heroism and rediscover the spiritual superhero you were before the world put a label on you.\n\n“Authenticity and love of one’s fellow man emanate from Levi Welton’s life and words. He calls for and exemplifies an integration of ‘distinct cultures fused together.’ This is a rabbi's call to personal greatness and one man’s honest and sincere reflection on the path of fully being both a Jew and a committed member of the human family.” - Rabbi Zalman Kastel, Founder of the non-profit Together For Humanity",747733146-3,24.49,21,1.4,12,Break Out Press,2022-07-29,AVigR8TVx3DI,Religion & Spirituality,0,2023-10-26T16:52:45.024Z,2023-11-04T16:36:08.387Z,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the final leg of his journey, he travels to Europe and spends months walking a thousand miles across France and Spain, following the ancient pilgrimage road known as the Camino.\n\n\nPart memoir and part travelogue, in this book Shawn vividly describes some of Europe's most spectacular landscapes, and shares the challenges he encounters with language barriers, foreign customs, and the physical hardships of life as a pilgrim. Travelling in the centuries-old footsteps of the pilgrims who've gone before him, he seeks to uncover the true meaning of a pilgrimage.\n\n\nAs he adjusts to the day-to-day rigors of such a long journey, Shawn sees the Camino's rich connection to history. He delves into the lives and legacies of the figures associated with some of the milestones along his walk, revisiting the folklore surrounding the lives of Sainte Foy and the rise of Christianity, Roland and the advent of chivalry, and El Cid and the fate of the Reconquista.\n\n\nSharing tales of thieving monks, savage priests, and banished knights, Shawn brings Europe's colorful past to life. While sifting through fact and legend, he provides a sweeping narrative of the medieval ages as it relates to Europe, Christianity, and this pilgrimage.\n\n\nAs his own journey unfolds, Shawn finds humor and wisdom in each misstep. He shares the insights that come to him as he faces the obstacles between him and his goal. Walking over mountains, across plains, and through storms, Shawn embraces the commitment required to fulfill his dream. Through this journey of self-discovery, Shawn learns what it truly means to be a pilgrim, and finds what we all seek-a life of meaning and purpose.\n\n\nPick up your copy of A Thousand Miles to Santiago and start the adventure today!",9798985779905,39.25,57,3,26,"Smokeless Mirror L.L.C., 2022",1911-10-28,cMoEo2a2FAVE,"Religion, Christianity, History\nBiography & Autobiography / Religious\nReligion / Christianity / History\nTravel / Essays & Travelogues",0,2023-10-26T16:52:45.024Z,2023-11-04T02:46:43.063Z,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is also a book about two remarkable, pain-filled lives from Scripture, Job and Jesus. The author believes that Job has much to teach those in pain. He is like each of us, she says, human and trying to do the right thing out of our flawed-but-faithful hearts. And Jesus, of course is the prime example of accepting and embracing pain even as he died on the cross. Though many of us still need strength, courage, and self-awareness to build our faith and ministry, the author says, we have Jesus' light to guide us, and his example to emulate. This book challenges readers to follow the example of Job and most of all Jesus, in accepting pain and in believing there are many joys awaiting them, if they choose to reach out, look, hope and live...beyond pain.

Cancer, tumor, stroke, traumatic injury, or major surgery—a health crisis of any kind involves waiting. This waiting arouses many emotions: fear, uncertainty, sorrow, agony, and anger among them. In this devotional for caregivers and patients, Elizabeth Reynolds Turnage reminds us of the certain hope and surpassing peace of the gospel: God has worked miraculous deeds and redemptive wonders in the past, and Jesus will “soon” come again to end our wait, and to bring full and final healing. These sixty meditations for peace and hope will encourage you as you wait.\nEndorsements:\n\nThis brilliant book is a tender gift of the presence of God for those caught in the deep woods of medical uncertainty. When we are in the hospital waiting for resolution, we don’t need a long chapter of admonitions or vague mumblings of comfort. We need a guide who has traversed this terrain and has a compass and a map to help us orient our journey. Elizabeth Turnage offers a wisdom that has been hard won, meets the test of the gospel, and is beautifully and brilliantly written. I can’t recommend this book more highly than to say you need a copy for yourself and eventually for every friend or family member who is called to wait for redemption.\n\nDan B. Allender PhD, Professor of Counseling Psychology, Founding PresidentThe Seattle School of Theology and Psychology\n\nElizabeth writes to anyone who finds themselves in the waiting room of God’s sovereign purposes.

In The One We Left Behind, the day is ruined because of the weird, new kid in town. Due to food allergies, William and his family are forcing ridiculous food restrictions on the ENTIRE seventh grade. No more pizza. No more peanut butter. Not even a candy bar. It's completely unfair!\n\nEvan, who already has enough to worry about-maintaining his ""cool guy"" status, his reputation as the best batter in his grade, and impressing the more intimidating students and teachers-is chosen first to sit alone in a room with this geek. What kind of kid can't sit in a school cafeteria? And why should it be Evan's problem?\n\nWilliam becomes the most taunted and teased boy at school. Yet in that first week, Evan realizes he doesn't actually hate being stuck with William. No kid has EVER made Evan laugh so hard. William is also a whiz with baseball statistics, a fabulous prank puller, and a pretty good listener.\n\nBut when the week is over, will Evan risk everything to befriend the school loser? It's not his fault that William is so dorky, pale and ""different."" Why should Evan help the ""allergy kid"" just because he was assigned to be his first ""lunch buddy?"" What is Evan supposed to do when the other kids pick on William, and the bullying starts to escalate?\n\nThe One We Left Behind explores unlikely friendships, the angst of growing up, and the desire to be accepted for who you are. It reminds readers that decisions sometimes have consequences that can never be taken back.\n\nEditorial Reviews\n""In this debut YA novel, a teenager in 1995 finds himself torn between his social status and his growing friendship with the class nerd.\n\nJunior high is a new experience for 13-year-old Evan Roth in Columbus, Ohio. He’d been a popular athlete, but seventh grade overflows with tweens and teens from different elementary schools. Sadly, it looks as if he won’t make a good impression the first week, as he’s the assigned “lunch buddy” of the Cincinnati transfer student. William Nash has severe food allergies and must eat lunch in a classroom rather than the crowded cafeteria. Evan finds the situation alarming: “Lunch was one of the times when kids figured out who would be leaders, who would be followers, and who would be left with no friends at all.” But it turns out Evan and William have a lot in common, including their love of baseball. Being friends with William is an adjustment for Evan, as he and his fellow students learn how to use an “epi” in case the boy goes into anaphylactic shock. But William is worth it, and Evan enjoys hanging out with him. Yet Evan likes to be popular, too, which sometimes involves keeping his head down while others tease and openly mock William. Evan may have to choose—siding with insensitive bullies or a warm, funny, and generous guy. Each of Coven’s believable characters is chock-full of personality, as not all bullies are entirely apathetic and not every mother is as affectionate as Evan’s. William shows the most layers; he’s often unruffled when peers toss out insults (dubbing him Casper on account of his pale skin), but he’s devastated when convinced he’s a burden to his parents.
